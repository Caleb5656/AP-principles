# 4. Arithmetic Operations

These are ways of doing mathmatical operations on numbers and include:

**+ - * / %**





___





# 5. Assignment Operations

???





___





# 6. Comments

comments are made using a (**#**), making a comment causes the text to only be readable by the programmer and ignored when the program is ran





___





# 7. Decision Structures

???





___





# 8. Conditional Operators

b == d   b is equal to d (Not the same as =)

b != d   b is not equal to d

b > d    b is more than d

b < d    b is less than d

b <= d   b is less than or equal to d

b >= d   b is more than or equal to d





___





# 9. Logic Operators

b and d  condition is true if each part of the **_and_** is true

b or d   condition is true if at least one part of the **_or_** is true

b not d  condition is true if b is true and d is false

# 11. String Methods

.trim removes the spaces in a string

.find looks for a given string within the original string

.casefold makes a string lowercase

.





___





# 12. Random Generation

from random import randint 

num = randint((Low end number), (High end number))





___





# 13. Looping Structures

## For loops
used to loop through code while within a range of numbers

for i in range(x, z)

## While loops
used to loop through code while a condition is not met

Must be careful and remember to increment the variable so your loop doesn't run forever

while i > 0
